# Credit Card Fraud Detection

My goal for this project was to gain some exposure to machine learning algorthims and a taste of data science. So I created a couple of classifers and compared the different models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Bagging (Random Forest)
4. Boosting(XGBoost)
5. Multilayer Preceptrons

## Data

I used the dataset available on kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data

It was very imbalanced, but no missing values!

I also watched some of Greg Hogg's video as a guide to help me think through preprocessing the data
